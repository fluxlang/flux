# Flux Overview #
This file contains the major differences between Flux and other programming languages.


## Data types ##
To keep the language simple, there are only four types:

- byte
- boolean
- number
- text



## Data structures ##
There is only one base data structure, called a 'group'. Somewhat similar to a Java LinkedHashMap. Every other data structure can be made from that.



## Tests ##
Tests can be automatically created (and ran!) from simple syntax in the function comment/description.

The language tooling can also suggest test cases to define and can automatically create the simple testing syntax for the functions.
